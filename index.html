	<p>
		Bangladesh is a country state in <b> Southern Asia</b> (converging with Southeast Asia), bordering the Bay of Bengal to the South, almost entirely encircled by <i>India</i>  to the West, North and East, and <i>Myanmar</i>  to the Southeast. <br>
		Although off the beaten path by virtually any measurement, Bangladesh is populated by friendly locals.<br>
	
		The country is primarily a low-lying plain of about 144,000 km2, situated on deltas of large rivers flowing from the Himalayas: the Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal. The country is primarily flat fertile farmland and, with the exception of Chittagong Hill Tracts, rarely exceeds 10 meters above sea level, making it dangerously susceptible to changes in sea level.
